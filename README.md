# Linter
An attempt to make Unreal Engine projects more consistent.

This is a test (**IsBetaVersion**, **IsExperimentalVersion**) build of Linter ported to 5.3+.

# Notes
As of this time, the Linter source code needs a frontend rewrite. The mechanisms by which Menus are added/hooked have been changed in Unreal Engine to the point Linter broke.
However, Linter can be ran from the command-line/terminal and this does work. You can generate JSON and HTML reports, in the meanwhile. This was tested on Linux.

**THIS PLUGIN IS NOT PRE-BUILT! I CANNOT FACILITATE THAT.**

# Credit
This is not my project but I am attempting to fix it and make it accessible. It's free on Epic Marketplace, I assume it is safe to share here. See https://github.com/Allar/ue5-style-guide for more information.
